                    This is my own production of Skip The Dishes. I used Vue2, Vuetify, Vue-cookies, Pinia, and Composition API for state management, with Axios communicating to the backend.

                <p class="pa-6 display-1 font-weight-bold grey--text">
                    The backend utilizes Python and Flask to create the database endpoints, with MySQL/MariaDB handling the queries.

                    Feel free to browse the restaurants and their respective menus.

                    Register to get authentication and then have access to place an order!

                    Features currently in the works include the frontend for the restaurants' side where they can join, create menu items, add a profile, and handle orders.  The backend has been implemented.
                </p>
                <p class="pa-6 display-1 font-weight-bold grey--text">
                    These features will be added shortly.  Until then, have fun exploring!
